# Sparkle
Sparkle is a thin, modular, game engine for JavaScript that uses a component-based entity framework.

## Example Game
Peep `web/test.html` using a web browser, browse `example/` for the source. 

The example game is silly (for now), but it illustrates how to build a game using Sparkle. 

More to come soon.
